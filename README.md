Add a Solitare Spider Game to your page, activated by a key combination.

## [DEMO](http://joaoricardo000.github.io/spider-easter-egg/)

![DEMO](http://i.imgur.com/X7A2usV.png)


Just add a single line of script, edit the *data-keys* attribute to your favorite key combination, and done!

```
<script data-keys="qaz" src="//joaoricardo000.github.io/spider-easter-egg/js/spider-egg.js" id="spiderEggJs"></script>
```


## Project disclaimer.

The source of the game (spider.js) was written many many years ago by a friend, and I gave some continuity at the time.  
We were both in university, and did this to develop some programming skills.  
Thats why the code looks alwful.  
But, the most incredible thing, is that still works! And inside an iframe won't hurt anybody.  
It was developed using only vanilla js, no requirements needed.

Feel free to refactor, and good luck.
